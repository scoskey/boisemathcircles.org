We looked at different voting and election systems, including first-past-the-post,
two-round runoff, instant runoff, Borda count, and the Condorcet criterion.
We voted for the best candy (the winner was chocolate peanut butter cups, but it was close!).
We watched a PBS Infinite Series video about voting, and worked through some
puzzles and problems. The video is here:

We also invented our own voting system, where voters rank the candidates, and
the one with the most last-place votes is eliminated (instead of the one with the fewest first-place votes).
We called it "voting off the island".
