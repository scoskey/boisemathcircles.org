On Saturday, January 28, we had a Boise Math Teachers' Circle session. We revisited the "Two Coin Systems" from our <a href={{ "bmtc-sessions/ellipses-coins-fractals" | relative_url }}>previous session</a> and went on "scrambled fraction tours", where we walked partway to different sites in different orders.
