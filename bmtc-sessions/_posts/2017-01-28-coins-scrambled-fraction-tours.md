<p>On Saturday, January 28, we had a Boise Math Teachers' Circle session. We revisited the "Two Coin Systems" from our <a href="http://boisemathcircles.org/math-teachers-circle-ellipses-coins-and-fractals/">previous session</a> and went on "scrambled fraction tours", where we walked partway to different sites in different orders.</p>
