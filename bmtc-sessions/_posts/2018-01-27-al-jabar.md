In this session we played the <a href="https://al-jabargames.com/">Al-Jabar game</a> of color-mixing algebra. First we learned how to perform addition and subtraction with colors.

We made several versions of the addition table for colors.

You can see a subgroup of the first four rows and columns, and how it divides the addition table into four quadrants.
