We explored mathematical concepts in statistics and calculus in a context of finance.
Jennifer Eldred, who is a teacher at Kuna High School,
shared some activities that she prepared as part of her master's thesis at Boise State.
The activities are available on her web site:

Today we did two activities.
First we worked through an activity that related life insurance and expected value.
We found a formula for the value of an investment in terms of the yearly payment amount
and the interest rate, using geometric series.
We looked at actuarial tables and a lifespan simulator
(<a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/09/23/years-you-have-left-to-live-probably/">Years You Have Left to Live, Probably</a>)
to get a sense of how long a life insurance policy is likely to take to pay out,
and whether that makes it a worthwhile policy for the policyholder, or the insurance company.

Second we worked through an activity that related calculus and debt.
Geometric series showed up again!
