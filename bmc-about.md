title: About the BMC

The Boise Math Circle meets weekly or biweekly on Saturdays. Each meeting delivers an elementary topic with deep roots in mathematical theory. Many of these topics are not usually covered in school. The goal is for each participant to feel a spark and discover something new for themselves.

The typical meeting format begins with background and motivating questions, and then transitions into group work and guided discussions. Participants work on open-ended problems together in small groups, and then discuss their findings with the other groups.

Our activities differ from other extracurricular math programs in that it does not provide tutoring or support for school curriculum. The meetings are intended to be stress-free and encouraging. There are no grades, no competition, and no homework. Instead we encourage lots of collaboration and a loose classroom structure.

## Who participates
We welcome Treasure Valley youth in grades 6-12 of all achievement backgrounds who have an independent interest in mathematics. We strongly encourage students from under-represented groups to join.

## More about the math
We try to choose topics that are both accessible to middle and high school students, and interesting to research mathematicians. They may be chosen from any subfield of mathematics including: combinatorics, number theory, game theory, geometry, advanced algebra, set theory, and more. For specific examples of topics, you can always browse our <a href="http://boisemathcircles.org/category/session/">recent sessions</a>.

## Who we are
The Circle is hosted by the mathematics department at Boise State University, and run by two of its faculty. The Circle will also feature visitors and guest discussion leaders on a regular basis.
