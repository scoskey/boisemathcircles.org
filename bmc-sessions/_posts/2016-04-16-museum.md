Suppose you have a room, and you need to guard it using ceiling mounted cameras. Assume the cameras can see in 360 degrees. If the room is very simple, such as a square shape, you can get away with just one. But if the room is more complicated, say with nooks and crannies, you may need many cameras. How can you find how many?
