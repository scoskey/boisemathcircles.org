Continuing with our introduction to combinatorics, this time we explored the structure side of things and introduced graph theory.<!--more-->

A graph is a diagram with dots called vertices and lines joining the dots called edges. In this lesson, we looked at the class scheduling problem as a way to motivate constructing graph structures. We also saw how the class scheduling problem corresponds to a problem about coloring the vertices of a graph.
