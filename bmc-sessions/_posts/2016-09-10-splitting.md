Suppose you are sending a crew of scientists to the moons of Mars: Phobos and Deimos. The scientists are botanists, geologists, and mathematicians, or any combination of the three. You want to divide the crew into to halves so that each moon gets an equal number of each scientists. When can this be done?<!--more-->

We investigated this question during our first session of the BMC. There are some pretty interesting patterns to be found! The problem has been studied in great detail during the summer research program at Boise State!
