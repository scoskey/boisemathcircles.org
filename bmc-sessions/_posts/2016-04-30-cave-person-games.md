<ul>
<li>Solitaire: The rules are simple: given several piles of stones, take one stone from each pile to make a new one. Repeat the process. What happens over time?</li>
<li>Simple nim: Two players have a pile of stones. They alternate taking just one stone or two stones. The winner is the one who takes the last stone. (Or alternately, the loser is the one who takes the last stone.)</li>
<li>Nim: Two players have several piles of stones. They alternate taking any number of stones from  just one of the piles. The winner is the one who takes the last stone. (Or alternately, the loser is the one who takes the last stone.)</li>
