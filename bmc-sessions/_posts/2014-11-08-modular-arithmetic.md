title: Numbers on clocks
tags: group-theory modular-arithmetic
---

For this session, we worked on Modular Arithmetic by thinking about a circular number line arranged like a clock.<!--more-->
  
Some of the questions we asked:
<ul>
<li>How can someone do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using just a few numbers positioned around a clock?</li>
<li>What does it mean to do, for example, mod 6 math?</li>
<li>How can someone solve equations using mod math?</li>
<li>What patterns can you find my making an addition table using mod math?</li>
<li>What patterns can you find my making a multiplication table using mod math?</li>
<li>What patterns can you find by looking at powers (of, say, 2) in mod math?</li>
<li>How might you use mod math to scramble a message?</li>
</ul>
