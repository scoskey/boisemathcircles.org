In this discussion we explored Caesar ciphers and keyword substitution ciphers. We borrowed a handout from another math circle. We especially had fun decoding the Alice in Wonderland quotation on page 6!<!--more-->

By the way, the cipher we did on page 6 of the handout was a little harder than just an ordinary keyword cipher! That caught us off guard :)
