Imagine three friends play a game. Mia beats Alex, Alex beats Siki, and Siki beats Mia. Which one of the three, if any, should we consider to be overall winner? In this session, we consider the idea of a **tournament**, which isÂ a series of one-on-one win-or-lose games in which every player plays everyone else one time.

We started the session by playing a Rock Paper Scissors tournament in small groups, and then in larger groups. We learned how to make a diagram of the tournament, and how to categorize players as "strong winners" and "weak winners".
