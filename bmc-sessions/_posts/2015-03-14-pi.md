March 14, 2015 was an auspicious date to have a 'math circle' meeting. We ate some great dessert, and worked on some really interesting questions, such as:<!--more-->

<ul>
<li>How <em>exactly</em> can you approximate π using regular polygons using just the Pythagorean Theorem?</li>
<li>What does it mean to find a 'best rational approximation' of a number?</li>
<li>How do you calculate continued fractions?</li>
<li>What are some continued fractions of popular irrational numbers?</li>
<li>What might be some ways to prove an infinitude continued fraction equals a specific irrational number?</li>
</ul>
