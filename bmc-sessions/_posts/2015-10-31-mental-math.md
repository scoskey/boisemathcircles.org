For our Halloween session, presenter Gary Thomas shared some wonderful skills and the abstract concepts that support day-to-day arithmetic.

One of the most exciting things we learned to do was multiply two digit numbers that are both near 50 or both near 100. I still need practice, but the method is surprisingly simple!

A great line from the handout:

<blockquote>
  Work in pairs, to be awares, of patterns you notice, in the squares (yes, Garyâ€™s a poet).
</blockquote>
