Regular tessellation means covering the plane with copies of a single regular polygon in such a way that the polygons meet edge to edge, with no overlap and no gaps. This can be done with triangles, squares, and hexagons. The shapes have N = 3, 4, and 6 sides, and the tessellations have C = 6, 4, and 3 shapes per corner, respectively. In all three cases, we can see that (N-2)(C-2)=4.

Can we make a tessellation with (N-2)(C-2)&lt;4? This is impossible in the plane, but possible on a sphere! There are five such tessellations, each corresponding to one of the five platonic solids.

Finally, what happens if (N-2)(C-2)&gt;4? This is impossible in the plane or sphere, but possible in "hyperbolic" space. In this activity we explore the Poincar√© disk model of hyperbolic geometry and show how it can be tessellated in many different ways. This mathematical foundation was used by Escher to make is "Circle Limit" tessellations.
