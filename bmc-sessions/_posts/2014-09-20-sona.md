The Sona sand drawings are part of the oral tradition of the Tchokwe people of Angola. The drawings are both art and science, and hold many interesting mathematical properties.<!--more-->

The Sona are drawn over a grid of dots according to certain rules: Start in between any two dots at a 45 degree angle, and reflect when you get to the edge of the diagram. Here is the first Sona drawing we made. For more, see this <a href="http://www.africafederation.net/Tchokwe_Art.htm">Sona sand drawings web site</a>!

We asked the questions:

* How many paths does it take to fill the grid?
* Does the outcome depend on where you started your paths?
* Does the outcome depend on the dimensions of the grid?
* What other patterns do you observe?
