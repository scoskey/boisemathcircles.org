We met to talk about a very simple, but really interesting, new pattern that can be created in the following way.

1. Start with a single toothpick
2. Add another toothpick at a right angle to each of the pointy-ends of the pattern
3. If two toothpicks, meet at  their pointy-ends, don't add toothpicks to the place they meet.

We started with actual toothpicks, and eventually started to see a neat pattern emerging. And then, things got all mathematical!<!--more-->

<h2>Questions We Asked</h2>
<ul>
<li>How many toothpicks are needed at each stage of the pattern?</li>
<li>How many NEW toothpicks are needed at each stage of the pattern?</li>
<li>How many squares get made in the pattern?</li>
<li>How many rectangles get made? What are their dimensions?</li>
<li>Will the pattern ever end?</li>
</ul>
<p>By carefully keeping track of the toothpicks at each stage, we figured out a way to generate all the numbers in the 'toothpick sequence' using previously calculated numbers. This means, we found a <em>recursive pattern </em>in the sequence of numbers.</p>

<h2>Bonus Question:</h2>
<p>Which stage of the pattern is shown in the picture?</p>
