In this discussion we explored Caesar ciphers and keyword substitution ciphers. We borrowed a handout from another math circle. We especially had fun decoding the Alice in Wonderland quotation on page 6!

## Handouts from the session

(Borrowed from Professor Radko at UCLA. By the way, the cipher from page 6 was a little harder than just an ordinary keyword cipher! That caught us off guard :)
