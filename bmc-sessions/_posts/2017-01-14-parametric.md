In this activity we explored periodic parametric curves. We particularly studied the patterns that arise when you change the periods of the $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ coordinates.<!--more-->

To start playing around with parametric curves, you will need geogebra. Then you can use the following link to download our geogebra worksheet!
