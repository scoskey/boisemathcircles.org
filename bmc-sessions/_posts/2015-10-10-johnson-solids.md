title: Solids from regular sides

In this session we asked what solids can be made using regular polygons as sides. We investigated this almost entirely by playing around with snap-together polygons. And thanks to our campus 3d printer, we got to handle some of the more obscure shapes too.<!--more-->

We also made the restriction that the solids should be <em>convex</em>, that is, have no indentation in them. This class of solids is called Here are some examples of some of the solids:

Although the combinations seem endless, amazingly Victor Zalgaller proved that other than the prisms, there are just 108 of these shapes!</p>
