For this last session of the Fall 2014 math circle, we explored a type of number puzzle involving labeling undirected graphs.<!--more-->

Some of the questions we explored:
<ul>
<li>How can we solve an arithmagraph puzzle using addition?</li>
<li>How can we solve an arithmagraph puzzle using multiplication?</li>
<li>What types of arithmagraphs can't be solved?</li>
<li>How many different ways are they to specific types of arithmagraphs?</li>
<li>What are some fool-proof ways to solve arithmagons?</li>
</ul>
