This may sound like a fancy title, but it just means figures with flat sides and a hole in the middle!

In this investigation we built toroidal polyhedra like this:

We observed that each of our shapes were made up of flat sides, line segments, and points. Then we counted each of these components and looked for patterns. Finally we took a look at classical polyhedra (without the hole in the middle) and compared the pattern for toroidal polyhedra with the pattern for classical ones.
