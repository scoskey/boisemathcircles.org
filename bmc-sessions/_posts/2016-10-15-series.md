title: Adding together infinitely many numbers
tags: series
---

It is often necessary to add more than two numbers together. For example, you might have made 137 deposits to your bank account this year, and wonder how much you contributed in total. But is it possible to add infinitely many numbers together? The answer is that sometimes it is possible, and sometimes it isn't! In this discussion we investigated when, why, and how!

By the way, we also set a record with 20 student participants at this meeting. Thank you for attending!
