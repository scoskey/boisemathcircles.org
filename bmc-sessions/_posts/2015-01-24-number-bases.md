title: Ways to write numbers
tags: arithmetic

How do we write our numbers? When ten units get together, they make one new thing. We keep this new thing in a separate box to keep track of its status. This is called the 1←10 rule. Some people think we use the 1←10 rule because we have ten fingers. But what if we had a different number of fingers? Or a different type of rule altogether?<!--more-->

<p>In this discussion, we took on the following tasks.</p>
<h2>Part One</h2>
<p>Task 1: Convert numbers to base 3 or base 5 using the 1←3 or 1←5 rule. Can every number be written in base 3? Can every number be written in base 5?</p>
<p>Task 2: Convert numbers from base 3 or 5 to our regular system using the rules in reverse</p>
<p>Task 3: Add and subtract numbers in base 3 or 5 (without converting to decimal)<br />
(hint: carrying and borrowing require using the rule in different ways)</p>
<p>Task 4: Write the powers of 2 in base 5 (hint: double each answer to get the next)</p>
<p>Task 5: Complete the following multiplication problems in base 5<br />
12034 x 3<br />
30442 x 120<br />
1004^4<br />
... (make up your own)</p>
<p>Task 6: Try doing some division problem in base 5 (hint: use the rule to help you find the divisor)<br />
12304 / 21<br />
23222 / 14<br />
1/2<br />
... (make up your own)</p>
<p>In base 5, five things explode together to become just one. But what if some things explode to become something other than one?</p>
<h2>Part two</h2>
<p>We can also find new bases if we let the number on the left side of the arrow be something other than one.</p>
<p>Task 7: Try converting numbers to base 3/2 using the 2←3 rule. Can every whole number be written in base 3/2?</p>
<p>Task 8: Try converting numbers from base 3/2 back to base 10. Try doing 21221. Now try doing 21212. What difficulties do you encounter?</p>
<p>Which numbers in base 3/2 can be successfully converted back to base 10?</p>
<p>Which fractions in base 10 can be successfully written in base 3/2? Can 15/4 be written (without using fractions) in base 3/2? Can 5/4?</p>
<p>Task 9: Try converting numbers to base -4 using the -1←4 rule. Can every number be written in base -4? (First try allowing negative digits, an then try avoiding negative digits.)</p>
<p>Task 10: Try doing some addition and multiplication problems in base -4. Use the traditional “carrying” algorithm.</p>
