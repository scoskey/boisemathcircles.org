title: What is a math circle?
---

A math circle is a group of interested individuals who meet to study mathematics for its own sake.

Math circles differ widely and may take up any number of activities such as elementary problem solving or advanced reading. A math circle differs from a tutoring or enrichment program in that it is not supporting school curriculum.

Our particular circle connects secondary school students with university faculty mentors, and uses guided discovery to generate discussions. Read more on our page [about the BMC](bmc-about).

The BMC is the first IdahoÂ program to join the 150+ math circles registered with the [National Association of Math Circles](http://www.mathcircles.org).
